# High-Performance Go

mdsmith's hot path is the rule set running over every file
in the workspace. The Large benchmark gate parses 600 files
through the full rule set. One extra alloc per `Check` is
tens of thousands of extra allocs per `mdsmith check`. One
accidental O(n) rescan inside a rule turns a 0.8 s run into
several seconds. This page is the contributor playbook for
keeping that path fast.

This page is the methodology behind the project's budgets.
The ≤ 10 alloc ceiling lives in
[Allocation Budget](index.md#allocation-budget). The corpus
gates and `MDSMITH_CPUPROFILE` workflow live in the
[benchmark notes](../research/benchmarks/README.md).

## Process

**Apply best-practice patterns first. Then measure. Then
fix what is still hot.** The patterns in
[Patterns to apply](#patterns-to-apply) are known wins
across the Go core — pre-size a slice, hoist a regex,
return `nil` for an empty result. Use them by default;
they cost nothing.

Past that, profile before you rewrite — a flat profile in
your suspected hot path stops a useless fix. The loop:

1. **State the goal numerically.** "Function X under N
   allocs/call on representative input" — not "make it
   faster". Name the symbol (function, rule, package) and
   the input that hits its hot frame.
2. **Lock in a baseline** by running the package's
   existing benchmarks multiple times:

   ```bash
   go test -run=^$ -bench=. -count=10 -benchmem \
     ./path/to/package > old.txt
   ```

3. **Profile** the baseline. CPU profile if you don't know
   the bottleneck; alloc profile if `b.ReportAllocs` shows
   allocations; trace if latency is bad but CPU is idle.
4. **Change one thing.** Re-run the same benchmark, same
   count.
5. **Decide with `benchstat`,** not eyeballs. Re-run the
   benchmark into `new.txt`, then:

   ```bash
   benchstat old.txt new.txt
   ```

   `~` in the delta column means no significant change.
   p < 0.05 with a meaningful effect size is the bar.

**Write benchmarks that always run.** Put the bench next
to the code. Pin its budget inline with `b.Fatalf` on
overshoot, as `BenchmarkRule_MDS024` does. CI then catches
the next slip on its own.

Opt-in rules (those returning
`EnabledByDefault() == false`) skip `BenchmarkCheckCorpus*`,
so `perrule_bench_test.go` is their only time gate. It pins
each a `perRuleBenchBudget` row — `Time` near 5× the logged
baseline, `Allocs` near baseline plus `max(20%, 4)`.
`optInRules` finds new opt-in rules from `rule.All()`, so
the gate fails with "no pinned budget" until you add the
row. It times parse+Check together: parse dwarfs Check, but
constant parse cost lets the sum still catch a regression.
Allocs stay the tight gate (subtracted, deterministic).

To decide whether a rule needs the AST,
`testdata/rule_walk_audit.json` records each rule's class
(plan 2606022126). **Category A** rules scan `f.Lines` with no
AST. **Category B** rules drive `f.ProseRanges()` instead
of re-implementing fences. **AST-required** rules keep the
tree. No AST-walking rule is cleanly Category A today.

### Which profile answers which question

| Profile | Source                               | Question                          |
| ------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| CPU     | `-cpuprofile cpu.out`                | Where is time going?              |
| Memory  | `-memprofile m.out`                  | What allocates and what is live   |
| Block   | `runtime.SetBlockProfileRate(1)`     | Where do goroutines wait?         |
| Mutex   | `runtime.SetMutexProfileFraction(1)` | Who holds contended locks?        |
| Trace   | `-trace trace.out`                   | Scheduler / GC / syscall timeline |

View memory profiles with `go tool pprof -alloc_objects`
(every allocation, including freed) or `-inuse_objects`
(what is resident now).

mdsmith ships a profile hook for the CLI
(`internal/profiling/profiling.go`):

```bash
MDSMITH_CPUPROFILE=cpu.out mdsmith check .
go tool pprof -http=:8080 cpu.out
```

No CLI flag on purpose — the command line stays
byte-identical to production. For diffs, use
`go tool pprof -base=old.prof new.prof`.

### Escape analysis

Before adding `sync.Pool`, read what the compiler already
does:

```bash
go build -gcflags="-m=2" ./pkg/markdown 2>&1 | grep escape
```

Common causes of escape: returning a pointer to a local;
storing a value in `interface{}` / `any`; capturing a
variable in a closure that outlives the frame; slice or
map growth past a compile-time-known size. The stack costs
nothing; the heap costs an alloc plus future GC scan.

### Profile-guided optimization

PGO has been GA since Go 1.21 and lands 2–14% wins on real
binaries. Run `mdsmith check` over a representative corpus
with `MDSMITH_CPUPROFILE=cmd/mdsmith/default.pgo`; `go
build` then picks the file up automatically. Refresh after
major rule changes. Worth it for release builds, not for
one-off debug builds.

## Patterns to apply

The list below extends the project's existing
[Allocation Budget](index.md#allocation-budget) rules.
Reach for these first.

### Allocations

Each removed alloc in a per-file `Check` saves one alloc
per workspace file.

- **Pre-size slices.** `make([]T, 0, n)` when `n` is
  known. `append` doubles capacity up to ~1024 then grows
  ~25%, copying each step.
- **Reuse loop-local buffers.** `buf = buf[:0]` clears
  length, keeps capacity. See `extractTextBufPool` in
  `internal/mdtext/mdtext.go`.
- **`sync.Pool` for transient state.** Best for
  expensive, short-lived state (line scanners, AST
  scratch). Always reset before `Put`; pool entries can
  be reaped by GC without notice. Examples:
  `internal/punkt/tokenizer.go`,
  `internal/schema/validate_content.go`.
- **Return `nil`, not `[]T{}`.** Project convention.
  `nil` and a non-nil empty slice are distinguishable in
  tests, JSON, and `reflect`; sticking to `nil` for "no
  result" keeps callers uniform.
- **Compile regexes at package scope.**
  `var foo = regexp.MustCompile(…)`. Compiling inside a
  hot function builds the NFA every call.

### Strings and bytes

- **Stay in `[]byte`.** Each `string(b)` allocates and
  copies. `bytes.IndexByte` and `bytes.Contains` are
  SIMD-accelerated on amd64; faster than `strings.*` once
  you already have bytes.
- **`strings.Builder` over `+`.** Concatenation in a loop
  allocates a new backing array each time. Call
  `Grow(n)` first if you know the final size.
- **`strconv` over `fmt.Sprintf`.** `strconv.Itoa(n)` is
  ~3× faster than `fmt.Sprintf("%d", n)` and skips
  reflection.
- **`strings.EqualFold` for case-insensitive compare.**
  One pass, no allocation; beats `ToLower` + `==`.
- **`unsafe.String` / `unsafe.Slice` (Go 1.20+)** for
  zero-copy `[]byte`↔`string`. The caller must guarantee
  the source isn't mutated and outlives the view. Use
  sparingly, with a comment naming the invariant.

### Fixed-string search beats regex

`bytes.IndexByte('#')` is a hardware-assisted single-byte
scan. `regexp.MustCompile("#").FindIndex` builds an NFA
and walks it. For anything expressible as a literal,
substring, or prefix/suffix check, skip `regexp`.

### Data structures

- **Fixed-size arrays beat slices** when the size is
  known — no header, no escape.
- **`map[K]struct{}` for sets** — zero-byte value type.
- **Sorted slice + binary search** beats a map for
  n < ~100, thanks to cache locality. Benchmark at your
  real n.
- **Swiss tables in Go 1.24+.** Free 30–60% map speedup
  and up to 70% map-memory reduction; no code change
  needed.

### Struct layout

- **Order fields large-to-small** to minimize padding.
  The `fieldalignment` analyzer in `golang.org/x/tools`
  flags layouts with wasted bytes and can rewrite them.
- **Hot/cold split.** Frequently-read fields in one
  struct, rarely-read in another behind a pointer.
  Better cache utilization in the hot path.
- **Prefer `[]Foo` over `[]*Foo`.** A value slice is one
  GC-scanned allocation with zero internal pointers; the
  pointer slice forces N pointer scans every cycle.

### Skip work you don't need

The cheapest call is the one you never make. Two real
mdsmith wins live here:

- **Memoize per-input computations.** When a helper runs
  many times over the same `*lint.File`, cache the result
  on the File. The cached newline index in
  `lint.(*File).LineOfOffset` replaced an O(n) rescan per
  call — ~24% of `check` CPU on long prose before the
  fix.
- **Gate expensive analyzers behind a cheap pre-check.**
  An upper- or lower-bound check that proves the
  expensive path can't produce a diagnostic lets you
  skip it. MDS024's guard skips the sentence tokenizer
  when no paragraph can violate either limit — ~2 GB of
  saved allocations on the 600-file gate corpus.

### Inlining

The inliner has a budget (~80 nodes per function). Keep
hot functions tiny so they inline; outline the slow path
into a separate function. The canonical model is
`sync.Mutex.Lock`: the uncontended CAS inlines; the
contended slow path is a separate function.

Inspect with `go build -gcflags="-m=2"` and look for
`can inline foo` / `inlining call to foo`.

### Concurrency

- **`sync/atomic`** for one-word flags and counters
  (`atomic.Bool`, `atomic.Int64`, `atomic.Pointer[T]`).
- **`sync.Once`** for lazy init. After the first call,
  it costs a single atomic load.
- **`sync.Mutex`** for >1-word critical sections.
  Default choice. Cheaper than `sync.RWMutex` under low
  contention.
- **Channels for handoff or backpressure**, not for
  protecting a single variable — under contention a
  channel is orders of magnitude slower than a mutex.
- **`errgroup.SetLimit(n)`** for bounded fan-out. Size
  by bottleneck: `runtime.NumCPU()` for CPU-bound, much
  higher for I/O-bound.
- **Every goroutine must exit on `ctx.Done()`.** Test
  with `go.uber.org/goleak`.

## Patterns to avoid

Every [Patterns to apply](#patterns-to-apply) rule has an
inverse anti-pattern. Reaching for `fmt.Sprintf`, `+` in a
loop, an un-`make`d `append`, `[]T{}`, `any`, `regexp` for
a literal, goroutine-per-item, or a channel for one
variable are the obvious ones. A few more are below.

| Avoid                                | Why                                | Use instead                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `defer` in a tight loop              | falls off the open-coded fast path | hoist or inline cleanup            |
| `reflect` in hot paths               | type-info walks, allocations       | code-gen or hand-roll              |
| `log.Printf` per item in a hot loop  | format + lock + I/O                | sample, or batch outside the loop  |
| `time.Now()` in a tight loop         | wall + monotonic read each call    | read once, use `time.Since`        |
| `os.ReadFile` on huge inputs         | one giant alloc, all resident      | `bufio.Reader` with a tuned buffer |
| `context.Background()` deep in calls | loses cancellation                 | propagate caller's `ctx`           |

## Tooling

See [Process](#process) for the `benchstat`, `pprof`, and
`goleak` workflow. `go tool -modfile=tools/go.mod
golangci-lint run` is the lint gate. Its `perfsprint`,
`prealloc`, and gocritic performance group are worth
enabling on top of `.golangci.yml`.
